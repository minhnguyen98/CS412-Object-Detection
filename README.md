# CS412-Object-Detection
Object detection in class CS412 of APCS

# How to run

We have made everything as simple as possible. First, just initial the project (by fetching Darknet):

```bash
bash init.sh
```

Then to run, just import images to input/ directory and:

```bash
bash run.sh
```

After bash run.sh has done, you can see result in output/ directory
